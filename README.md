# Portfolio_Website
A personal portfolio website inspired by a retro space terminal UI. Designed in Figma, structured using Agile practices (whiteboard planning &amp; component-based development), and built with a full stack approach using React.js and Flask. It showcases interactive projects, supports GitHub API integration, and demonstrates dynamic content handling.
